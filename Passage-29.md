### **Passage on India's Renewable Energy Transition (2020-2024)**  

Between 2020 and 2024, India made significant strides in its transition toward renewable energy, aiming to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and meet its climate commitments. The government aggressively expanded solar and wind energy projects, with an ambitious target of achieving **500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030**.  

One of the key policies driving this transition was the **Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for solar manufacturing**, which encouraged domestic production of photovoltaic (PV) modules, reducing reliance on imports. Additionally, the Green Hydrogen Mission, launched in 2023, aimed to position India as a global leader in hydrogen production, particularly for industrial and transportation sectors.  

To enhance energy security, the government promoted **floating solar farms, offshore wind energy, and battery storage solutions**. The International Solar Alliance (ISA), co-founded by India, played a crucial role in fostering global solar energy collaborations.  

However, challenges remained. **Land acquisition, high initial costs, and integration of renewable energy into the national grid** posed difficulties. Despite these hurdles, India emerged as the **world’s third-largest producer of renewable energy by 2024**, significantly increasing its share of green energy in total power generation.  

The renewable energy transition also created **millions of new jobs**, especially in solar panel manufacturing, installation, and maintenance. Investments from both public and private sectors continued to flow, ensuring that India remained on track to achieve its ambitious climate goals.
