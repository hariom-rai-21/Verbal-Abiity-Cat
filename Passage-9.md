### **Passage:**  
Tax evasion and tax avoidance are two significant issues that impact government revenue and economic stability. While both involve reducing tax liabilities, they differ in legality and ethical considerations. **Tax evasion** is an illegal practice where individuals or businesses deliberately conceal income, falsify records, or fail to pay taxes owed. This results in severe penalties, including fines and imprisonment. On the other hand, **tax avoidance** refers to legally exploiting loopholes in the tax system to minimize tax payments. Although legal, it is often criticized for being unethical as it deprives governments of necessary revenue.  

Governments worldwide implement various measures to combat tax evasion, including stricter regulations, improved tax enforcement, and international cooperation to track hidden assets. Additionally, some countries reform their tax codes to close loopholes that enable tax avoidance, ensuring a fairer system for all taxpayers.  

A well-functioning tax system relies on public trust and voluntary compliance. When citizens perceive the system as fair and transparent, they are more likely to pay their taxes honestly. Therefore, striking a balance between reasonable taxation and effective enforcement is crucial for maintaining economic stability and public confidence.
