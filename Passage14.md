### **Passage:**  
Tax evasion and tax avoidance are two common issues that affect government revenue collection. Although they may seem similar, there is a significant difference between the two. **Tax evasion** refers to **illegal practices** where individuals or businesses deliberately **hide income, falsify records, or fail to pay taxes** to reduce their tax liability. It is a criminal offense and can result in heavy penalties, fines, or even imprisonment.  

On the other hand, **tax avoidance** involves **using legal methods** to minimize tax liability by taking advantage of loopholes or exemptions in tax laws. For example, businesses may use tax deductions, offshore accounts, or corporate structuring to reduce their tax burden. While tax avoidance is legal, it is often criticized for being unethical, as it reduces the government’s ability to generate revenue for public services.  

Governments combat tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance by enforcing strict regulations, increasing financial transparency, and implementing **anti-tax avoidance measures**, such as the General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR). These measures help close loopholes and ensure that all individuals and corporations contribute their fair share to the economy.  

While taxpayers have the right to legally minimize their taxes, it is essential to strike a balance between **tax planning and ethical responsibility** to ensure fairness in the tax system.
