### **Passage:**  
In recent years, the concept of sustainable living has gained significant traction as concerns about climate change, resource depletion, and environmental degradation have intensified. Sustainable living emphasizes reducing one’s ecological footprint by making conscious choices that minimize harm to the environment. This can include adopting practices such as conserving energy, reducing waste, using eco-friendly products, and supporting sustainable agriculture.  

While many individuals are eager to embrace sustainable habits, critics argue that focusing solely on personal responsibility oversimplifies the complexity of environmental issues. They contend that large-scale systemic changes, such as government policies, corporate accountability, and technological innovations, are far more impactful in addressing climate challenges. After all, individual efforts, though meaningful, may seem insignificant when compared to the carbon emissions of major industries.  

However, proponents of sustainable living believe that individual actions can create a ripple effect, influencing communities, shaping consumer demand, and pressuring corporations and governments to adopt greener practices. Moreover, personal responsibility fosters environmental awareness, which is crucial for building a culture that values sustainability. The key lies in balancing individual efforts with systemic reforms to achieve lasting environmental progress.
