### **Passage on Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India (2020-2024)**  

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) was introduced in India on July 1, 2017, as a comprehensive indirect tax reform that replaced multiple state and central taxes. Between 2020 and 2024, the GST system underwent several modifications to improve compliance, increase revenue collection, and simplify the taxation structure for businesses.  

One of the significant reforms during this period was the introduction of e-invoicing for businesses above a specified turnover threshold. Initially implemented for large businesses in 2020, the threshold was gradually reduced, bringing medium and small enterprises under the e-invoicing system by 2023. This step enhanced transparency and reduced tax evasion.  

To support businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, the government announced multiple relief measures, such as deferred tax payments, waiver of late fees, and lower interest rates on delayed payments. Additionally, compliance requirements were temporarily eased to help small and medium enterprises (SMEs) recover from economic disruptions.  

The GST Council, which governs the tax structure, made several changes to tax rates between 2020 and 2024. Some essential items, including medical supplies and COVID-19 vaccines, were temporarily placed under a reduced tax rate category to ensure affordability. However, luxury items and sin goods (such as tobacco and alcohol) saw increased tax rates to generate additional revenue.  

A significant step toward automation was the introduction of AI-driven compliance monitoring and automatic reconciliation of input tax credits (ITC). These measures helped in reducing fraudulent claims and ensuring smooth tax administration. By 2024, most GST processes, including return filing and invoice matching, had been fully automated, making compliance easier for businesses.  

The implementation of the GST Appellate Tribunal in 2023 provided businesses with a faster mechanism to resolve tax disputes, reducing the backlog of cases in courts. Furthermore, the government took steps to rationalize the GST structure by considering the merger of the 12% and 18% tax slabs into a single rate to simplify the system.  

With these reforms, GST revenue collections steadily increased, crossing the ₹1.5 lakh crore mark multiple times in 2023 and 2024. The digital transformation of GST administration led to better compliance and a more transparent tax regime.
