### **Passage on U.S. Immigration Policies (2020-2024)**  

Between 2020 and 2024, **U.S. immigration policies** underwent significant changes, reflecting shifts in political priorities and public opinion. When **Joe Biden** became president in 2021, his administration reversed several restrictive immigration policies implemented by the previous administration. Efforts were made to provide **pathways to citizenship** for undocumented immigrants and protect **Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients**, also known as **Dreamers**.  

The administration also ended the **“Remain in Mexico” policy**, which required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases were processed in U.S. courts. Additionally, **refugee admissions were increased**, allowing more individuals fleeing conflict and persecution to settle in the United States. However, immigration remained a controversial topic, with opposition from lawmakers advocating for **stricter border security**.  

The **U.S.-Mexico border** remained a major issue, with record numbers of migrants attempting to cross. The **Title 42 policy**, originally introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic to restrict asylum claims, was eventually lifted in 2023, leading to new challenges in border enforcement. The **Biden administration increased resources for border patrol agents** while also proposing immigration reforms aimed at improving the legal immigration process.  

Despite efforts to create a more humane immigration system, challenges persisted. **Border security, labor shortages, and pathways to citizenship** became central issues in the 2024 **presidential election**, with debates on how to balance security and humanitarian concerns shaping public discourse.
