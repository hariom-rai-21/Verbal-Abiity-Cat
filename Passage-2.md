### **Passage:**  
The concept of "growth mindset," popularized by psychologist Carol Dweck, suggests that individuals who believe their abilities can be developed through effort, learning, and perseverance tend to achieve more than those with a "fixed mindset," who view their talents as innate and unchangeable. This idea has been widely embraced in educational settings, with teachers encouraging students to view challenges as opportunities for growth rather than as threats to their intelligence.  

However, critics argue that the growth mindset has been oversimplified in its application. Some educators mistakenly believe that merely praising effort, without considering the effectiveness of learning strategies, is enough to foster improvement. Others point out that emphasizing mindset alone may overlook structural issues such as unequal access to resources, quality education, and supportive environments, which also play critical roles in academic success.  

Despite these criticisms, the growth mindset remains influential because it shifts the focus from innate ability to the process of learning itself. When applied thoughtfully, it can cultivate resilience, adaptability, and a lifelong love for learning. The key lies in balancing the psychological aspects of motivation with practical strategies and systemic support to create meaningful and lasting change.
