### **Passage on India's Fiscal Policies and Economic Reforms (2020-2024)**  

Between 2020 and 2024, India underwent significant fiscal policy shifts to address economic challenges and drive sustainable growth. The government focused on balancing economic stimulus with fiscal prudence, especially in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, global inflation, and geopolitical tensions.  

In 2020, India announced the **Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India) initiative**, which included fiscal support for businesses, tax reliefs, and production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes to boost manufacturing. The fiscal deficit, which surged to **9.3% of GDP in FY 2020-21**, gradually declined due to improved tax collections, expenditure rationalization, and higher disinvestment proceeds.  

The introduction of the **National Monetization Pipeline (NMP)** aimed to unlock the value of public sector assets by leasing them to private players while maintaining government ownership. This helped generate additional revenue for infrastructure development. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) system was further streamlined, with rate rationalization and compliance simplifications leading to **record-breaking GST collections surpassing ₹1.5 lakh crore per month by 2023**.  

In 2022-23, fiscal consolidation was prioritized, with an emphasis on capital expenditure, particularly in infrastructure, green energy, and digital transformation. The **Union Budget 2023-24** outlined a roadmap to bring the fiscal deficit down to **5.9% of GDP**, targeting **4.5% by FY 2025-26**.  

Despite these reforms, **inflationary pressures and global supply chain disruptions** posed challenges. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) adopted **a tight monetary policy**, increasing the repo rate to curb inflation. The government's push for **direct tax reforms**, including the simplification of income tax slabs and the promotion of the new tax regime, was aimed at broadening the tax base.  

By 2024, India’s fiscal strategy reflected a **balanced approach**, ensuring economic resilience while maintaining fiscal discipline. The continued push for infrastructure development, digital taxation, and privatization was expected to shape the country’s long-term fiscal outlook.
