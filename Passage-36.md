### **Passage on U.S. Climate Policies (2020-2024)**  

Between 2020 and 2024, the **United States intensified its climate policies** to address global warming and environmental sustainability. One of the first steps taken by **President Joe Biden** after taking office in 2021 was **rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement**, reversing the previous administration’s withdrawal. This signaled America’s renewed commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and collaborating with other nations on climate action.  

In 2022, the **Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)** was signed into law, marking the largest **climate investment in U.S. history**. The act allocated billions of dollars for **clean energy projects, electric vehicle (EV) expansion, and tax incentives for renewable energy production**. It also aimed to cut U.S. carbon emissions by nearly **40% by 2030**.  

The U.S. government also promoted the transition to **electric vehicles** by offering tax credits for EV buyers and investing in charging infrastructure. Companies like **Tesla, Ford, and General Motors** expanded their EV production to meet growing demand. Meanwhile, stricter **regulations on fossil fuel industries** were implemented to limit carbon pollution, though this faced opposition from oil and gas companies.  

Extreme weather events, including **wildfires, hurricanes, and heatwaves**, increased during this period, reinforcing the urgency of climate action. The **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** introduced new rules to reduce methane emissions, while the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) invested in **solar, wind, and nuclear energy research** to diversify clean energy sources.  

Despite advancements, climate policy remained a divisive issue, with political debates over balancing **economic growth and environmental responsibility**. By 2024, as the **presidential election approached**, climate policy was a major topic, shaping public opinion and government priorities.
