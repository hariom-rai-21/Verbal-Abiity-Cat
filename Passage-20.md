Between 2020 and 2024, Jharkhand's political landscape experienced significant developments, culminating in the 2024 Legislative Assembly elections.

**2024 Jharkhand Legislative Assembly Election**

The 2024 elections were held in three phases from November 13 to 20, with votes counted on November 24. The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), led by Chief Minister Hemant Soren, secured 34 out of 81 seats, obtaining 23.44% of the popular vote. The JMM's alliance, the Mahagathbandhan (also known as the INDIA Bloc), which includes the Indian National Congress, CPI(ML)L, and RJD, collectively won 56 seats, accounting for 44.37% of the vote. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured 21 seats with 33.18% of the popular vote, while its alliance, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), won a total of 24 seats, representing 38.14% of the vote.

**Key Election Issues**

Several pivotal issues influenced the 2024 Jharkhand elections:

- **Religious Polarization:** The BJP's campaign emphasized concerns over "infiltration" by Bangladeshis, introducing narratives such as "love jihad" and "land jihad." These claims suggested that "infiltrators" were marrying tribal women to acquire land, leading to a decline in the tribal population. However, these assertions faced skepticism from various quarters, including tribal communities and civil society organizations. 

- **Tribal Land Rights:** Land rights remained a central issue. The previous BJP government had implemented the "land banks" policy in 2016, which, along with amendments to land acquisition laws, led to concerns about the appropriation of tribal lands by corporations. The JMM campaigned on preserving tribal culture, land, and identity, pledging to implement land registers based on a 1932 survey to determine domicile status.

- **Populist Welfare Schemes:** Both major parties introduced welfare initiatives targeting key voter demographics. The JMM's "Mukhyamantri Maiya Samman Yojana" provided financial assistance to women, which was countered by the BJP's "Gogo-Didi Yojana." In response, the JMM increased its scheme’s payout, effective December 2024. The BJP also pledged subsidized LPG cylinders, monthly stipends for unemployed graduates, and extensive job creation programs.
**State vs. Central Government Dynamics**

Tensions between the state and central governments were evident, with the JMM accusing the BJP-led central government of withholding funds owed to Jharkhand. Chief Minister Soren demanded the release of ₹1.36 trillion in dues from coal companies, emphasizing that these were rightful state funds, not special grants. 

**Corruption Allegations**

Corruption charges also played a role in the political discourse. BJP leaders highlighted alleged involvement of Chief Minister Soren in a land-related money laundering case. The JMM countered by asserting that the BJP was unfairly targeting Soren due to his tribal identity. 

These developments underscore the complex interplay of social, economic, and political factors that shaped Jharkhand's political environment between 2020 and 2024.
