### **Passage:**  
The concept of sustainable development has gained significant attention in recent years as the world grapples with environmental challenges such as climate change, resource depletion, and biodiversity loss. Sustainable development refers to meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This approach emphasizes a balance between economic growth, environmental protection, and social equity.  

While economic development is essential for improving living standards, unchecked industrialization and overconsumption have led to severe environmental degradation. Deforestation, pollution, and excessive greenhouse gas emissions are some of the consequences of unsustainable practices. To address these issues, governments, businesses, and individuals are encouraged to adopt eco-friendly technologies, promote renewable energy, and support conservation efforts.  

Achieving sustainable development requires global cooperation and a shift in mindset from short-term gains to long-term sustainability. Education, policy reforms, and community engagement play crucial roles in fostering a culture that values environmental stewardship alongside economic progress.
