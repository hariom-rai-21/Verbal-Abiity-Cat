Between 2020 and 2024, Bihar's political landscape underwent significant transformations, marked by pivotal elections and shifting alliances.

**2020 Bihar Legislative Assembly Election**

In the 2020 Bihar Legislative  Assembly elections, the  National Democratic  Alliance (NDA), comprising the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Janata Dal  (United) [JD(U)],  secured a  majority with 125 out of 243 seats. The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) emerged as the  single largest party with 75  seats, while the BJP  won 74 seats, and the JD(U) secured 43 seats. Nitish Kumar of the JD(U) continued as Chief Minister, underscoring the NDA's  dominance in the state. 

**2024 Lok Sabha Elections**

The 2024 Lok Sabha elections witnessed the NDA maintaining its  stronghold in Bihar, winning 30 out of 40 seats. However, this marked a decrease from their previous tally, with  losses in constituencies such as Kishanganj, Katihar, Purnia, Jahanabad, Patliputra, Arrah, Buxar, Aurangabad, and Sasaram. The INDIA bloc  secured nine seats, and independent candidate Pappu Yadav won the Purnia constituency. 

**Shifts in Political Alliances**

Significant budget allocations were directed toward projects in Bihar, aiming to bolster economic growth and address regional disparities.
