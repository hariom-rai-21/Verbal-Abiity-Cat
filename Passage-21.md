Between 2020 and 2024, Haryana's political landscape underwent significant transformations, marked by pivotal events and policy debates that shaped the state's governance and electoral outcomes.

**2024 Haryana Legislative Assembly Election**

The 2024 Haryana Legislative Assembly election was a focal point in the state's political narrative. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, defied exit poll predictions by securing 48 seats, enabling it to form the government. The Indian National Congress (INC) trailed with 37 seats. The unexpected results led the Congress to raise concerns about potential electoral discrepancies, including allegations of electronic voting machine manipulation, which they planned to address with the Election Commission of India. 

**Key Political Developments**

- **Coalition Dynamics:** In March 2024, the coalition between the BJP and the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) dissolved, prompting Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar to resign. Nayab Singh Saini of the BJP assumed the role of Chief Minister with support from independent legislators. However, by May 2024, the withdrawal of support by three independents rendered Saini's government a minority. 
- **2024 Lok Sabha Elections:** In the 2024 general elections, the BJP and the Congress each secured five of Haryana's ten Lok Sabha seats, reflecting a competitive political environment ahead of the state assembly elections. 

**Major Election Issues**

1. **Farmers' Protests and Agricultural Policies:** The introduction of three farm laws by the central government in 2020 sparked widespread protests among Haryana's farmers, who feared adverse effects on their livelihoods. Demands for legally mandated Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for crops became a central issue, with farmer unions advocating for guaranteed fair prices to ensure financial stability. 

2. **Agnipath Scheme:** Launched in June 2022, the Agnipath Scheme proposed a four-year term for military recruits, after which only 25% would continue in service. This move raised concerns in Haryana about employment stability for soldiers. In response, the state government announced a 10% quota for Agniveers in police and mining guard positions to mitigate potential job insecurity.

3. **Unemployment and Inflation:** High unemployment rates and rising inflation were significant concerns. Opposition parties criticized the BJP government's policies, attributing them to increased joblessness and higher living costs, making these issues central to electoral debates.

4. **Wrestler Protests:** Haryana, known for its wrestling tradition, witnessed protests led by wrestlers against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, the former chief of the Wrestling Federation of India, over allegations of sexual harassment. These events highlighted concerns about athlete safety and governance in sports institutions.
**Campaign Strategies**

- **BJP:** The BJP emphasized its achievements in infrastructure development and merit-based job creation. Prime Minister Modi labeled the Congress as "dishonest and deceitful" during rallies. The party also implemented leadership changes, limiting former Chief Minister Khattar's campaign involvement due to past controversies, and highlighted Saini's OBC background and populist measures to garner support. 

- **Congress:** The Congress launched the "Haryana Maange Hisab Abhiyan" campaign, criticizing the BJP on issues like unemployment, crime rates, and farmer grievances. Former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and state Congress chief Udai Bhan led initiatives to engage with voters and gather input for their manifesto. 

These developments underscore the dynamic political environment in Haryana between 2020 and 2024, reflecting broader national debates and regional concerns.
