### **Passage: The Importance of Financial Literacy**  

Financial literacy is the ability to understand and manage personal finances effectively. It includes knowledge of budgeting, saving, investing, debt management, and retirement planning. In todayâ€™s world, financial literacy is crucial for making informed decisions about money and achieving long-term financial stability.  

One key aspect of financial literacy is **budgeting**, which involves tracking income and expenses to ensure that spending does not exceed earnings. People who budget wisely can avoid unnecessary debt and build emergency savings. Another important component is **saving and investing**. While saving provides financial security, investing allows individuals to grow their wealth over time through assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate.  

Debt management is another critical skill. Many people struggle with high-interest loans and credit card debt, which can lead to financial difficulties. Understanding how to use credit responsibly and pay off debts efficiently can prevent financial stress. Additionally, planning for retirement by contributing to pension funds or retirement accounts ensures a secure future.  

Governments and educational institutions are recognizing the importance of financial literacy and promoting programs to teach individuals how to manage their money effectively. A well-informed population is better equipped to make sound financial choices, leading to economic stability and reduced financial crises.
