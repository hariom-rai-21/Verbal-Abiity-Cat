### **Passage on U.S. Space Exploration (2020-2024)**  

Between 2020 and 2024, the **United States continued to lead global space exploration**, with major advancements in both government-led and private  sector missions. NASA focused on the **Artemis program**, which aimed to return humans to the Moon for the first time since 1972. **Artemis I**, an uncrewed mission, successfully launched in 2022, testing the **Orion spacecraft** and the **Space Launch System (SLS)**. The next phase, **Artemis II**, planned for 2024, aimed to send astronauts on a lunar flyby.  

The private space industry, led by companies like **SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Boeing**, played a crucial role in expanding commercial space travel. SpaceX's **Starship rocket** became central to NASA’s plans for a Moon landing, while its **Crew Dragon missions** continued transporting astronauts to the **International Space Station (ISS)**. The rise of **space tourism** saw private citizens traveling beyond Earth's atmosphere, with **Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic** launching suborbital flights.  

Meanwhile, the U.S. also expanded its **Mars exploration efforts**,  supporting missions like the **Perseverance rover** and **Ingenuity helicopter**, which provided critical data about the Martian surface. NASA also worked on developing **nuclear-powered propulsion systems** to make deep-space travel faster and more efficient.  

The **U.S. Space Force**, established in 2019,  continued to develop **space-based defense systems** and satellite operations.  There was also increasing competition in space exploration, particularly with **China and Russia**, who developed their own lunar and Mars programs.  

By 2024,  space exploration had become a key topic in science and policy, with debates over **space resource mining, international cooperation, and regulations for private space travel** shaping the future of the industry.
