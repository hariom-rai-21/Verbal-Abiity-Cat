### **Passage:**  
Indirect taxes are a crucial part of government revenue and affect consumers and businesses in various ways. Unlike direct taxes, which are paid directly to the government by individuals or businesses (such as income tax), **indirect taxes** are collected by intermediaries, such as retailers or service providers, and then passed on to the government. Examples include **sales tax, value-added tax (VAT), excise duty, and customs duty**.  

One significant characteristic of indirect taxes is that they are **regressive**, meaning they impact lower-income individuals more than higher-income individuals. Since these taxes are included in the price of goods and services, everyone pays the same amount regardless of income level, which can disproportionately affect those with lower earnings.  

Governments use indirect taxes for several purposes. Besides generating revenue, they are often used to discourage the consumption of harmful products like tobacco and alcohol (through **sin taxes**) and to control imports and exports through **customs duties**. However, critics argue that excessive reliance on indirect taxes can increase the cost of living and burden low-income households.  

To balance the impact, some governments implement exemptions or lower tax rates on essential goods such as food and medicine. Striking a balance between revenue generation and social fairness is essential for an effective tax system.
