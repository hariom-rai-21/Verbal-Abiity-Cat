### **Passage:**  
Taxation plays a crucial role in shaping a country's economy, influencing both government policies and individual financial decisions. One important aspect of taxation is **corporate tax**, which is levied on the profits of businesses. Governments use corporate taxes to generate revenue, fund public services, and regulate economic activities. However, corporate tax rates vary significantly across countries, leading some businesses to shift their operations to regions with lower tax rates, a practice known as **tax inversion**.  

To prevent tax avoidance, many governments implement strict tax policies and international agreements to ensure that corporations pay their fair share. Some countries also provide tax incentives, such as reduced tax rates or exemptions, to encourage investment and economic growth. However, critics argue that excessive tax incentives can lead to revenue loss and create unfair advantages for large corporations over small businesses.  

Another key issue in corporate taxation is **double taxation**, which occurs when a company's profits are taxed at both the corporate and individual levels—first as corporate income tax and then as dividend tax when profits are distributed to shareholders. Some governments address this issue by offering tax credits or lower dividend tax rates.  

Balancing corporate tax policies is essential for maintaining economic stability, attracting investments, and ensuring fairness in the tax system. Policymakers must carefully design tax laws that support business growth while preventing tax evasion and maintaining government revenue.
