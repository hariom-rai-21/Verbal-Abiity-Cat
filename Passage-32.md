### **Passage on Manipur’s Political and Social Developments (2020-2024)**  

Manipur, a northeastern state of India, witnessed significant political and social changes between 2020 and 2024. The **Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)** retained power in the **2022 Manipur Legislative Assembly elections**, with Chief Minister **N. Biren Singh** continuing his leadership. The government focused on infrastructure development, employment generation, and addressing ethnic conflicts in the region.  

One of the key initiatives during this period was the **"Go to Hills" and "Go to Village" campaigns**, aimed at **bringing government services and welfare schemes to remote areas**. These programs helped improve access to healthcare, education, and basic infrastructure for tribal communities. The state also saw improvements in road connectivity through **projects under the Bharatmala and Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)**, enhancing trade and mobility.  

However, Manipur also faced **ethnic tensions and violent clashes** between different communities, particularly between the **Meitei and Kuki-Zo groups** in 2023. These conflicts led to **displacement of thousands of people** and a major security crisis, prompting the central government to deploy additional paramilitary forces to restore peace. The situation highlighted long-standing issues related to land rights, tribal identity, and political representation.  

Economically, the state continued to focus on **agriculture, handloom, and tourism**, with efforts to boost local businesses and promote traditional crafts. The **Manipur Start-up Policy** provided support to young entrepreneurs, encouraging innovation and self-employment. Additionally, the **Look East Policy** and improved trade relations with Myanmar aimed to integrate Manipur into regional economic networks.  

Despite challenges, Manipur made progress in **sports and cultural development**, with athletes from the state excelling in **national and international events**. The success of Manipuri players in the **Olympics and Asian Games** brought national recognition to the state's sporting talent.
