### **Passage on U.S. Foreign Policy (2020-2024)**  

Between 2020 and 2024, the United States pursued an active foreign policy, addressing multiple global challenges and maintaining its position as a dominant global power. President **Joe Biden’s** administration focused on rebuilding international alliances that had been strained under the previous government. The **United States rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement** and strengthened ties with NATO and European allies to counter growing threats from Russia and China.  

A key foreign policy challenge was the **Ukraine-Russia war**, which began in 2022. The U.S. provided substantial **military and financial aid to Ukraine**, supporting its defense against Russian aggression. This involvement led to tensions between the U.S. and Russia, with diplomatic relations reaching their lowest point since the Cold War.  

Relations with **China** remained complicated due to economic competition, trade restrictions, and military activities in the South China Sea and around Taiwan. The U.S. government imposed **sanctions on Chinese companies**, restricted the export of advanced semiconductors, and maintained strong military alliances with Japan, South Korea, and Australia under initiatives like **AUKUS**.  

In the **Middle East**, the Biden administration attempted to revive the **Iran Nuclear Deal** but faced opposition from both Iran and domestic critics. Meanwhile, the U.S. maintained its close alliance with **Israel** and monitored rising tensions in the region.  

The **withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in 2021** continued to impact U.S. foreign policy. The withdrawal ended America’s longest war but raised concerns over human rights and security in the region, as the Taliban regained control.  

By 2024, as the next U.S. presidential election approached, foreign policy debates centered on **America’s role in global security, economic competition with China, and the future of NATO alliances**. The administration’s actions in these areas shaped both domestic political discussions and international relations.
