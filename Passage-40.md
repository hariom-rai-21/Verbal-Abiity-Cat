### **Passage on U.S.-China Relations (2020-2024)**  

Between 2020 and 2024, **U.S.-China relations** remained tense due to geopolitical, economic, and technological competition. The Biden administration maintained a **tough stance on China**, continuing trade restrictions and imposing **sanctions on Chinese technology firms** to limit their access to advanced semiconductor technology. The U.S. also strengthened alliances in the Indo-Pacific region, forming **AUKUS** (Australia, U.K., and U.S.) and deepening cooperation with **Japan, South Korea, and India** to counter China’s influence.  

A major point of contention was **Taiwan**, which China considers part of its territory. The U.S. increased military support for Taiwan, selling advanced weapons and conducting naval exercises in the South China Sea. This led to diplomatic protests from China and a rise in military tensions.  

Trade disputes continued as the U.S. kept **tariffs on Chinese imports**, first imposed during the Trump administration. Meanwhile, **China retaliated by restricting U.S. businesses operating in China**, leading to economic uncertainty. The **global supply chain crisis**, worsened by COVID-19 and rising tensions, forced the U.S. to invest in **domestic semiconductor production** through the **CHIPS and Science Act** to reduce dependency on Chinese manufacturing.  

The U.S. also criticized China’s **human rights policies**, particularly regarding **Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and censorship**. Sanctions were placed on Chinese officials accused of repressing ethnic minorities, further straining relations. Despite these conflicts, both nations remained economically interconnected, with **China being one of the largest trading partners of the U.S.**  

As the **2024 U.S. presidential election** approached, **relations with China became a key debate**, with candidates arguing over trade policies, national security, and economic independence. The future of U.S.-China relations remained uncertain, influenced by both political and economic factors.
