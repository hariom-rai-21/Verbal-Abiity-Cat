### **Passage on Income Tax in India (2020-2024)**  

Income tax in India is governed by the Income Tax Act, 1961, and is collected  by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) under the Ministry of Finance. Over the years, the government has  introduced various reforms to simplify tax compliance, improve transparency, and encourage voluntary tax payments. Between 2020 and 2024, significant changes were made to the income tax system to boost economic growth and widen the tax base.

In 2020, the government introduced a new optional  tax  regime  under which individuals could pay lower tax rates if they chose to forgo certain deductions and exemptions. This regime aimed to simplify tax filing but did not see widespread adoption initially, as many taxpayers preferred the traditional system with deductions for expenses like house rent, provident fund contributions, and insurance premiums.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the government provided relief measures such as extensions of tax filing deadlines and reductions in late fees to support taxpayers. The pandemic also accelerated the digitalization of tax processes, with initiatives like the faceless assessment and appeals system, which reduced the need for physical interaction between taxpayers and tax officers.

In the Union Budgets of 2021 and 2022, further tax benefits were introduced for senior citizens and small taxpayers. Additionally, tax rates for corporate entities were lowered to attract investments, and incentives were given to startups and new businesses to promote economic recovery. The government also focused on increasing tax compliance by introducing stricter penalties for tax evasion and enhancing data analytics to track underreported income.

In 2023, the government made the new tax regime the default system while still allowing taxpayers to opt for the old regime. This move was aimed at simplifying the tax structure and reducing the need for tax planning. By 2024, the tax system in India had become more digitalized, with artificial intelligence (AI) being used for fraud detection and automated processing of refunds, leading to greater efficiency in tax administration.
