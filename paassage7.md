### **Passage:**  
Taxation is a fundamental tool used by governments to generate revenue for public services such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, and national defense. Taxes can be broadly categorized into direct and indirect taxes. Direct taxes, like income tax and corporate tax, are levied directly on individuals and organizations based on their earnings or profits. Indirect taxes, such as sales tax, value-added tax (VAT), and excise duties, are applied to goods and services and are typically paid by consumers at the point of purchase.  

One key principle of taxation is equity, which suggests that taxes should be fair and based on the taxpayer's ability to pay. Progressive tax systems, where tax rates increase with higher income levels, aim to achieve this fairness by placing a greater burden on those who can afford to contribute more. In contrast, regressive taxes, like sales taxes, tend to disproportionately affect lower-income individuals since they consume a larger portion of their income on taxable goods.  

While taxes are essential for funding government activities, high tax rates can sometimes discourage investment and economic growth. Therefore, policymakers strive to design tax systems that balance revenue generation with economic efficiency and fairness. Additionally, efforts to combat tax evasion and ensure compliance are crucial for maintaining the integrity of tax systems worldwide.
