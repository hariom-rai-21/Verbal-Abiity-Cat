Between 2020 and 2024, Jammu and Kashmir underwent significant political transformations, marked by administrative changes, legal challenges, and a pivotal election that reshaped its governance.

**Revocation of Special Status and Administrative Reorganization**

In August 2019, the Indian government abrogated Article 370 of the Constitution, revoking the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. Subsequently, the state was bifurcated into two Union Territories: Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. This move led to the dissolution of the state assembly and the imposition of President's rule, centralizing administrative control. 

**Delimitation and Legal Developments**

In March 2020, a Delimitation Commission was established to redraw the electoral boundaries within the Union Territory. The commission's final report, released in May 2022, increased the total number of assembly seats to 90, with a notable addition of six seats in the Jammu division and one in the Kashmir division. This redistricting was significant as it altered the political landscape ahead of future elections.

In December 2023, the Supreme Court of India upheld the abrogation of Article 370, affirming its constitutionality. The court also mandated the Election Commission to conduct legislative assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir by September 30, 2024, emphasizing the restoration of democratic processes in the region. citeturn0search2

**2024 Legislative Assembly Election**

The legislative assembly elections were held in three phases from September 18 to October 1, 2024, marking the first such election in over a decade. The results, announced on October 8, 2024, saw the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference (JKNC), in alliance with the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)), securing a majority by winning 49 out of the 90 seats. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged as the second-largest party, obtaining 29 seats and achieving the highest vote share at 26%.

**Challenges and Public Sentiment**

The period leading up to the elections was characterized by public disillusionment and a desire to assert regional identity. Many residents viewed the elections as an opportunity to express dissent against the central government's policies, particularly the revocation of the region's special status. Despite the BJP's efforts, there was a notable decline in its support within the Muslim-majority areas, reflecting widespread resentment towards perceived assaults on Kashmiri identity. 

The newly elected government faces significant challenges, including addressing public discontent, restoring civil liberties, and managing the region's complex relationship with the central government. The political developments between 2020 and 2024 have set the stage for a critical period in Jammu and Kashmir's governance and its quest for stability and autonomy.
