Between 2020 and 2025, Delhi's political landscape experienced significant shifts, culminating in a historic election that altered the city's governance after nearly three decades.

**2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly Election**

In the 2020 elections, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), under the leadership of Arvind Kejriwal, achieved a landslide victory, securing 62 out of 70 seats. This overwhelming mandate allowed AAP to continue its focus on education, healthcare, and public services, which had been central to its governance agenda.

**Challenges and Controversies**

During its tenure, AAP faced several challenges:

- **Legal Troubles:** Arvind Kejriwal encountered legal issues, including allegations of corruption, leading to his imprisonment and subsequent loss of his assembly seat.

- **Public Protests:** The city witnessed significant protests, notably against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), which tested the government's response to civil dissent.

**2025 Delhi Legislative Assembly Election**

The 2025 elections marked a dramatic shift in Delhi's political dynamics:

- **BJP's Resurgence:** The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, returned to power in Delhi after 27 years, winning 48 out of 70 seats. 

- **AAP's Decline:** AAP's representation reduced to 22 seats, with prominent leaders, including Kejriwal, losing their constituencies.

- **Congress's Performance:** The Indian National Congress failed to secure any seats, although its vote share increased by 2%, impacting AAP's margins in key constituencies.

**Factors Influencing the 2025 Election Outcome**

Several elements contributed to the BJP's victory:

- **Campaign Promises:** The BJP pledged financial assistance to the poor, women, and the elderly, along with subsidies for essentials like cooking gas. 

- **Middle-Class Support:** Analysts attributed BJP's success to support from the middle class, bolstered by recent tax breaks.

- **Governance Critique:** The BJP criticized AAP's handling of public services and governance issues, resonating with voters seeking change.

**Implications of the Election Results**

The BJP's return to power in Delhi is significant, not only for its political prestige but also for its potential impact on national politics. Controlling the capital allows the BJP to manage potential protests against the central government more effectively. For AAP, the loss confines its governance to the state of Punjab, marking a substantial retreat from its earlier prominence.

These developments underscore the evolving political dynamics in Delhi, reflecting broader national trends and voter sentiments between 2020 and 2025.
