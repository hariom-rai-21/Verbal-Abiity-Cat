### **Passage on U.S. Healthcare Reforms (2020-2024)**  

Between 2020 and 2024, the **U.S. healthcare system**  underwent significant reforms aimed at improving affordability, accessibility, and public health response. The **COVID-19  pandemic** highlighted weaknesses in the system, leading to increased government intervention to strengthen  medical infrastructure, expand insurance coverage, and improve preparedness for future health crises.  

The **American Rescue Plan (2021)**  introduced temporary **subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA)**, making health insurance more affordable for  millions of Americans. The Biden administration also sought to lower **prescription drug costs**,  particularly for senior citizens, by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. The **Inflation Reduction Act (2022)** further expanded these efforts by capping insulin prices and reducing out-of-pocket costs for Medicare recipients.  

Telemedicine saw rapid expansion during this period, allowing patients to access healthcare remotely. This was particularly beneficial in **rural areas** where medical facilities were scarce. Investments in **mental health services** also increased, as public awareness about mental health grew after the pandemic.  

Despite these advancements, healthcare remained a contentious issue, with debates over **universal healthcare,  private insurance, and government spending** shaping political discourse. By 2024, with the **presidential election approaching**, healthcare policies became a major point of discussion, influencing voter decisions and legislative priorities.
