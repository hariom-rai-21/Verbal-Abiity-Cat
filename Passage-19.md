Between 2020 and 2024, Uttar Pradesh (UP), India's most populous state, experienced significant political developments that reshaped its political landscape.

**2022 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly Election**

In the 2022 state elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, secured a consecutive term, reinforcing its political dominance in the state. The BJP's victory was attributed to its focus on law and order, infrastructure development, and welfare schemes.

**2024 Lok Sabha Elections**

The 2024 general elections marked a pivotal shift in UP's political dynamics. The Samajwadi Party (SP), under the leadership of Akhilesh Yadav, formed a strategic alliance with the Indian National Congress and other regional parties, collectively known as the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA). This coalition achieved a significant victory, winning 43 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in UP, surpassing the BJP, which secured 37 seats.

**Policy and Social Developments**

During this period, UP witnessed policy decisions that sparked debates on social harmony. In 2024, the state government mandated restaurants to display the names of their employees, a move criticized for potentially targeting Muslim workers and leading to economic marginalization.Additionally, the Supreme Court overturned a ban on Islamic schools (madrasas) in UP, allowing approximately 25,000 madrasas to continue operating, impacting around 2.7 million students.

These developments underscore the evolving political alliances and social policies in Uttar Pradesh between 2020 and 2024, reflecting broader national trends and regional dynamics.
