### **Passage:**  
In recent years, the debate over the impact of social media on mental health has gained significant attention. Proponents argue that social media fosters connections, enables the sharing of ideas, and provides a platform for marginalized voices. They believe it bridges geographical divides, allowing people to maintain relationships and build communities beyond physical limitations.  

However, critics highlight the darker side of social media. Studies have shown correlations between excessive social media use and increased feelings of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. The curated nature of online content often promotes unrealistic standards of success, beauty, and happiness, leading individuals to engage in constant comparison, which can erode self-esteem.  

Moreover, the phenomenon of "doomscrolling"—endlessly consuming negative news—can exacerbate stress and create a sense of helplessness. Despite these concerns, the issue is not black and white. The effects of social media are complex, influenced by factors such as the type of content consumed, the amount of time spent online, and individual personality traits.  

Striking a balance between the benefits and pitfalls of social media is essential. Rather than demonizing the platforms themselves, it may be more productive to focus on promoting healthy usage habits and fostering digital literacy to help individuals navigate the online world more mindfully.
