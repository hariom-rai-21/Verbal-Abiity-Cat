### **Passage on U.S. Political and Economic Developments (2020-2024)**  

The United States experienced significant political and economic shifts between 2020 and 2024. The **2020 Presidential Election** resulted in **Joe Biden** defeating **Donald Trump**, marking a shift in policies from the previous administration. Bidenâ€™s term focused on **economic recovery, climate change, healthcare expansion, and international diplomacy**. One of his key domestic policies was the **Inflation Reduction Act**, aimed at tackling rising prices and promoting clean energy investments.  

The U.S. economy faced multiple challenges, including **inflation, supply chain disruptions, and job market fluctuations** due to the aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, by 2023, the job market showed signs of improvement, with unemployment rates decreasing. The **Federal Reserve** took measures such as **interest rate hikes** to control inflation, which impacted sectors like housing and business investments.  

Internationally, the U.S. played a crucial role in global politics, particularly regarding **NATO, relations with China, and the Ukraine-Russia conflict**. The Biden administration provided **military and financial aid to Ukraine**, strengthening its stance against Russian aggression. Relations with China remained tense due to trade policies, technology competition, and diplomatic issues related to Taiwan.  

In the 2022 **midterm elections**, the **Republican Party gained control of the House of Representatives**, while Democrats maintained a narrow majority in the Senate. This led to political gridlock on several policy issues, including debt ceiling negotiations and immigration reforms.  

On the technological front, the U.S. continued its dominance in **artificial intelligence (AI), space exploration (with NASA and SpaceX missions), and semiconductor manufacturing**. The **CHIPS and Science Act** was introduced to boost domestic semiconductor production and reduce dependency on foreign suppliers, particularly China.  

Socially, the country saw debates over **gun control, abortion rights (after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022), and racial justice movements**. Protests and legal battles over these issues shaped much of the domestic discourse.  

By 2024, as the U.S. geared up for the **Presidential Election**, political polarization remained high, with debates over economic policies, foreign relations, and social issues dominating the landscape.
