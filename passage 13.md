### **Passage:**  
Governments rely on taxation as a primary source of revenue to fund public services such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, and defense. One important type of tax is the **Goods and Services Tax (GST)**, a form of indirect taxation applied to the sale of goods and services. GST is a **value-added tax (VAT)** system, meaning it is collected at multiple stages of production and distribution but ultimately paid by the end consumer.  

A key advantage of GST is that it helps **simplify the tax structure** by replacing multiple indirect taxes, such as sales tax and service tax, into a single system. This reduces tax evasion, increases transparency, and makes compliance easier for businesses. Additionally, GST follows a **destination-based taxation** principle, meaning tax is collected in the place where goods or services are consumed rather than where they are produced.  

However, the implementation of GST has faced criticism. Small businesses sometimes struggle with compliance due to complex filing requirements. Additionally, since GST applies uniformly to most goods and services, it can raise the cost of essential commodities for lower-income individuals, making it somewhat regressive. Some governments address this issue by **implementing different tax slabs**, where essential goods are taxed at lower rates or exempted, while luxury items face higher tax rates.  

Despite challenges, GST is widely regarded as an efficient and modern taxation system that enhances revenue collection while promoting economic growth.
